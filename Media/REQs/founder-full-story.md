# The Unlikely Revolutionary: How a Mechanic Became the Voice Against Big Tech's Biggest Lie

## The Accidental Journey

I never meant to end up in technology. Hell, I never even dreamed about it.

My hands were built for fixing things— as a firefighter pulling people from wreckage, a tow truck driver hauling broken-down dreams off highways, and as a mechanic bringing dead engines back to life. After selling everything I owned along with at-the-time High School sweetheart, we packed up and left Michigan for Florida with the wild dreams of two people in their early 20s desperately in love. A year or so passed since we moved, and I ran the local shop for the biggest tire, battery, and repair chain in the country—the kind of place where I came home every night smelling like motor oil and tire rubber. My wife actually loved that smell—it meant I was building something real, something you could touch.

Then fate walked through my shop door wearing an evil grin.

## The Invitation That Changed Everything

"Hey, I have an off-the-wall question," said the familiar face—our local IT helpdesk manager, a regular customer whose car I'd been fixing for years. "What do you think about coming to work with me?"

I genuinely laughed at him. Nothing about me screamed "tech person." I was the guy who diagnosed engine problems by listening to them purr. The guy who could rebuild a transmission with my eyes closed. The guy whose idea of advanced technology was a computerized alignment machine. I ran a shop for the biggest automotive chain in the country, and I was damn good at it.

But his logic was bulletproof: "Over a third of our calls are about point-of-sale systems and store operations. We need someone who understands how businesses actually work, not just how computers work. If you learn tech along the way, even better."

It was purely a financial decision. Guaranteed salary versus the performance bonuses and questionable P&Ls of retail management. So I traded my wrench for a headset and became the most unlikely "tech support" person you've ever met.

## The Room That Opened My Eyes

Six months later, I got summoned to a conference room that would change my life forever.

I walked into what I thought was a routine meeting and found myself face-to-face with company leadership and a team of IBM architects. They were planning an enterprise-wide transformation: T-1 to MPLS upgrades, POTS to VoIP migration, WiFi installation across over 1800 locations.

I had no idea why I was there. I knew what WiFi was, but the rest might as well have been spoken in ancient Greek.

Then I understood: I wasn't there for my tech knowledge. I was there because I understood **operations**. While the architects spoke in acronyms and protocols, my job was to translate: "How will this affect the morning rush? What happens when the system goes down during Black Friday? How do we train someone's grandmother to use this?"

That's when I discovered my superpower: **I could see both sides of the technology curtain.**

## The Education Nobody Planned

For the next two years, I lived between two worlds. Officially, I was still answering helpdesk calls. Unofficially, I had become the curiosity-driven guy who hung out with IBM's top architects during lunch breaks, eavesdropped on strategy sessions, and asked the questions nobody else thought to ask.

I wasn't trying to become a technologist. I was just naturally curious about how these impossibly complex systems actually worked—and more importantly, why they often didn't work for the people who needed them most.

Ray, one of the IBM architects, became my unofficial mentor. We'd grab dinner and he'd explain the thinking behind massive infrastructure decisions. I'd challenge him with real-world scenarios: "But what happens when Mrs. Johnson at Store #247 can't figure out how to process a return?"

That's when I learned the dirty secret of enterprise technology: most of it is built for the builders, not the users.

## The Call That Shocked Everyone (Including Me)

Three months after the project ended, my phone rang.

"Wanna come work for IBM?" Ray asked without preamble.

I burst out laughing. Again. This was IBM—450,000 employees, global technology giant, the company that basically invented enterprise computing. I was a mechanic with 2.5 years of "tech" experience, most of which involved telling people to turn things off and back on again.

"Trust me," Ray said. "Just apply."

The interview was unlike anything I'd expected. No technical quizzing. No whiteboard coding challenges. Instead, they threw scenarios at me: "How would you solve this business problem? What would you do if this system failed during peak hours? Walk us through your thinking process."

After an hour of this, Ray turned to the interviewer and said, "See, I told ya!"

I had to ask what he meant.

"Most people become architects through career progression," he explained. "They learn the technology first, then maybe learn to think strategically. You're the opposite. You already think like we do—you just need to learn the tech."

## The Leap of Faith

The offer came while I was home with my pregnant wife, nervously awaiting our first child. There it was in my inbox: an employment offer from IBM.

We faced an impossible decision: leave my stable position at a national automotive chain for the unknown world of global technology, or play it safe and stay in my comfort zone?

We leaped.

## Twenty Years Behind the Curtain

What followed was two decades of the most incredible education you could imagine. I traveled the world architecting solutions for Fortune 100 companies and federal agencies. I built technology infrastructure for sports arenas, guided global retail mergers through digital transformations, and stood in war rooms during cyber breaches.

I learned secrets that would make your head spin. I saw budgets that could fund small countries. I watched technology decisions get made that would affect millions of people—often by people who had never actually met one of those affected millions.

But most importantly, I learned something that haunts me to this day: **the biggest players in technology actively design systems to keep smaller players out.**

It's not malicious—it's systemic. Enterprise technology is built for enterprise buyers. The complexity, the costs, the vendor relationships, the implementation timelines—all of it creates a moat around capabilities that could revolutionize any business, if only they could access them.

I became the bridge between those two worlds. The translator who could explain why a $50 million system worked the way it did, and how you could get 80% of the benefit for 2% of the cost—if you knew what you were doing.

## The Breaking Point

Last year, I achieved 135% of my sales target at a global technology company. I won awards. I was invited to exclusive clubs. I was living the dream of enterprise success.

Then, on a Friday morning at 10:30 AM, my phone rang.

"We're letting you go," my boss said in a two-minute conversation that ended twenty years of enterprise loyalty.

By 11 AM, I was unemployed for the first time since I was seventeen. The shock wasn't just professional—it was existential. All those sacrifices, all those missed family dinners - dance recitals - t-ball games, all those Father's Days spent on emergency flights to distant data centers, watching your children (and beautiful wife) grow up in the pictures sent with that famous 'Missing you, Daddy!' caption. For what? Sure, I gave them an amazing life by societal standards, but at what cost?

After the dust settled, and I had some time to reflect I decided I was going to enjoy not being tethered to my phone, not be working this emergency or that emergency, not be up at 2am while my family is enjoying their beauty sleep trying to playing conductor to 50 engineers on a conference call frantically trying to restore a global retail chain's entire network before they open in less than 8 hours. I was going to be present in my home, go to my daughter's volleyball private lesson, enjoy an evening barbeque with friends, throw some bait with my son. For the first time in a very very long time I was going to just RELAX (because even on vacation you are still available at that level of tech - I've been on vacation with my wife and a SAT phone before. True story.).

After a while I started to get a little stir crazy sitting around the house, so I decided to go attend some local business networking events to see how the completely other side of business uses tech in cool and unique ways. I walked out of my first one, the Port Saint Lucie Business Club's monthly networking event, with this unbridled rage in my stomach. It was like I stepped back 10 years, at minimum, in time. The number of shocked looks I got when I would ask the 'why don't you do it this way' question, followed by most people asking if that can be done or isn't that expensive genuinely rocked me to my core. How do the people that account for DOUBLE the US GDP not even understand the fundamentals of today's technology and its capabilities? Then it all dawned on me and i got that pit-of-stomach feeling when your adreneline dumps, it's because we productize that knowledge... Nope, this stops. NOW.

That's when TriSynq was born. Not from ambition, but from rage. Not from opportunity, but from clarity.

## The Revolution Begins

TriSynq isn't just another startup. It's a **technology translation revolution** built on one simple premise: **transparency beats manipulation in every domain.**

I've seen how the giants play the game. I helped build their playbook. Now I'm writing a new one.

Here's what I learned in twenty years behind the enterprise curtain:

- **Complex doesn't mean better**—it just means more expensive and harder to escape
- **Vendor lock-in is intentional**—the maze is designed to keep you trapped
- **Enterprise capabilities aren't magic**—they're just well-engineered and well-hidden
- **Small businesses get scraps**—watered-down versions at premium prices

But here's what they don't want you to know: **you can have enterprise capabilities without enterprise complexity or enterprise costs.**

You just need someone who speaks both languages.

## The Team That Believes

I didn't build TriSynq alone. I found others who had seen the same dysfunction from different angles—data scientists tired of black-box analytics, AI engineers disgusted by hype-driven products, infrastructure architects fed up with vendor manipulation. And then we found those same people in markets they want to see change in.

Each of them had their own breaking point. Each of them chose transparency over profit maximization. Each of them believes that technology should serve people, not shareholders.

Together, we're not just building products—we're building **proof** that there's a better way.

## The Mission: Proving Transparency Works

TriSynq operates on a radical model: **the 20% and the 80%**.

We work **with the 20%**—the leaders, innovators, and challengers willing to test bold ideas and prove that transparency actually works. These aren't traditional clients—they're partners in proving a point.

But everything we build is **for the 80%**—the small businesses, nonprofits, educators, and community leaders who will benefit once we've proven transparency works at scale.

The 20% pave the road. The 80% get to walk it without fear.

## What Makes Us Different

I'm not a traditional entrepreneur. I'm not a Silicon Valley founder with venture capital and growth charts. I'm a mechanic-turned-architect who spent twenty years learning enterprise secrets and got fired for thinking too independently.

**Our superpower isn't coding—it's translation.**

We can see the $50 million enterprise solution and explain how to build the $50,000 version that does exactly what you need. We can look at vendor pricing and show you where they're charging 10x markup for basic functionality. We can take technology that seems impossibly complex and make it work for your specific reality. We can enforce transparency through technology.

Most importantly, I can do all of this **transparently**. No black boxes. No vendor lock-in. No surprise costs when you succeed.

## The Proof Is Coming

We're still small. Still scrappy. Still proving our theories with partners brave enough to test them.

But here's what we've already proven:
- **Enterprise capabilities at small business costs** (we've built it)
- **Transparent cost modeling that predicts growth** (we're using it ourselves)
- **AI that amplifies humans instead of replacing them** (it's running our operations)
- **Technology that adapts to your business instead of forcing you to adapt** (ask our partners)

## The Invitation

This is just the beginning. TriSynq is coming out of hiding, and what you'll see will challenge everything you've been told about technology, costs, and what's possible for your business.

**If you're part of the 20%**—the leaders willing to test new approaches—join us as a Proof Partner. Help us demonstrate that transparency wins.

**If you're in the 80%**—the businesses, nonprofits, and communities who've been locked out of real technology capabilities—follow our journey. We're building this for you.

**If you're a technologist** who's tired of building systems that serve shareholders instead of people—there's a place for you here too.

Above all, know this: as TriSynq steps into the light, there will be no smoke, no mirrors, no hidden agendas. We will show our work. We will share our failures alongside our wins. We will be transparent. Always.

Because transparency isn't just our strategy—it's our proof that there's a better way to build technology and better way to build businesses.

> *Don't worry about the how—we've got that covered. You bring the vision, and together we'll build the proof that transparency wins.*

## The Future We're Building

The enterprise technology world taught me that complexity sells and confusion pays. The bigger the price tag, the more "enterprise-grade" it must be. The harder it is to understand, the more sophisticated it appears.

**I'm here to call bullshit on all of that.**

Real sophistication is making complex things simple. Real enterprise-grade means it works for enterprises AND for the local nonprofit down the street. Real innovation means building technology that serves people, not stock prices.

TriSynq is my bet—our bet—that honesty beats manipulation, that transparency builds better businesses than secrecy, and that technology's future belongs to the people who've been locked out of its present.

The revolution starts with a simple premise: **What if technology actually worked for you?**

Stick around. We're about to show you exactly what that looks like.

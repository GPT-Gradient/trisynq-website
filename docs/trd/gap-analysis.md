## PART XIII: RISK ASSESSMENT

### High-Risk Items

**🔴 Risk: Scope Creep**
- **Issue:** 19+ new pages + major restructures
- **Impact:** Timeline extends beyond 2-3 weeks
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize critical path (navigation + Foundry pages + homepage)

**🔴 Risk: Content Quality**
- **Issue:** Large volume of new content needed
- **Impact:** Rushed content = lower quality
- **Mitigation:** Use TRD content as base, iterate post-launch

**🔴 Risk: Testing Coverage**
- **Issue:** 50+ pages to test + 6 form variants
- **Impact:** Bugs in production
- **Mitigation:** Automated testing + phased rollout

**🔴 Risk: User Confusion**
- **Issue:** Major navigation changes
- **Impact:** Users can't find what they need
- **Mitigation:** Clear "What's New" page, breadcrumbs, search

---

### Medium-Risk Items

**🟡 Risk: Screenshot Readiness**
- **Issue:** User says screenshots ready, but pages don't exist
- **Impact:** Mismatch between expectation and reality
- **Mitigation:** Clarify which screenshots exist, where to place

**🟡 Risk: SEO Impact**
- **Issue:** Not public yet, but route changes
- **Impact:** Minimal (site not indexed)
- **Mitigation:** Still implement proper redirects for future

**🟡 Risk: API Changes**
- **Issue:** New endpoints needed
- **Impact:** Backend development dependency
- **Mitigation:** Frontend can mock initially, integrate later

---

## PART XIV: CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS

### Must-Have for Launch (Week 1-2)

**Week 1 Priority:**
1. Navigation restructure (5 items)
2. Create /foundry/platform
3. Create /foundry/business/os
4. Update homepage (hero + new sections)
5. Global text replacements (TriSynq → ClearForge)

**Week 2 Priority:**
6. Create /continuum overview
7. Create /services hub + 4 pages
8. Create /forge landing hub
9. Contact form routing
10. Archive old Continuum projects

**Total Critical Path: 10 major items**

---

### Can-Wait for Post-Launch (Week 3+)

**Lower Priority:**
- Forge skeleton pages (knowledge, tools, community)
- /forge/build (transparency)
- Bridge imagery implementation
- About page consolidation
- Dashboard metric updates
- Foundry roadmap page
- /foundry/search detailed page

**These can ship with "Coming Soon" placeholders**

---

## PART XV: RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phased Approach

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Navigation restructure
- Global rebranding (TriSynq → ClearForge)
- Homepage updates
- Create 3 core Foundry pages (platform, business, business/os)

**Phase 2: Core Content (Week 2)**
- Services section (hub + 4 pages)
- Continuum overview + updates
- Contact form routing
- The Forge hub (landing only, skeletons for doors)

**Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)**
- Forge door pages (skeletons)
- About consolidation
- Dashboard enhancements
- Design updates (bridge imagery)

**Phase 4: Post-Launch Iteration (Week 4+)**
- Content refinement
- Performance optimization
- User feedback integration
- Blog/knowledge content

### Critical Dependencies

**Before Starting Development:**
1. ✅ Confirm screenshot locations/readiness
2. ✅ Confirm bridge image asset availability
3. ✅ Confirm API endpoint availability (or mock strategy)
4. ✅ Confirm content ownership (who writes new pages?)

**During Development:**
1. Navigation updates must complete first (blocks everything)
2. Global text replacements should be early (affects all pages)
3. Contact form routing needed before CTA updates

## CONCLUSION

### Overall Completion Status: ~15%

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Basic page structure (Next.js, components)
- ✅ Some pages at wrong routes
- ✅ API integration foundation
- ✅ Old branding throughout

**What's Missing:**
- 🔴 Correct navigation (0%)
- 🔴 Foundry product pages (0%)
- 🔴 Services pages (wrong location)
- 🔴 Contact form routing (0%)
- 🔴 Continuum integration (20%)
- 🔴 New content/messaging (30%)

**Biggest Gaps:**
1. Navigation completely wrong (7 items vs 5, wrong structure)
2. 19 pages missing entirely
3. Services under wrong route structure
4. No contact form routing
5. Global rebranding not done (TriSynq everywhere)

**Estimated Work Remaining:** 
- **23-31 developer days** (4.5-6 weeks full-time)
- **OR 9-12 weeks part-time**

**Critical Path:** 
- Week 1: Navigation + Homepage + Core Foundry pages
- Week 2: Services + Continuum + Contact routing
- Week 3+: Polish + iteration

**Recommendation:** Follow phased approach, prioritize critical path items, accept some "Coming Soon" placeholders for Week 3-4 items.

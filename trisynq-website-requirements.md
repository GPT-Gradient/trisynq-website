# TriSynq Website Complete Requirements Document

## **Project Overview**
Build a technology bridge website for TriSynq AI that connects untapped creative minds with transparent technology capabilities while positioning Shawn Sloan as the translator between possibility and implementation. The site serves as both a technology democratization platform and headquarters for unlocking the creative potential of the 90% locked out of today's technology revolution.

## **Design Philosophy & Aesthetic Requirements**

### **Johnny Ive Inspired Principles**
- **Purposeful Simplicity**: Every element serves a clear function
- **Emotional Resonance**: Design creates immediate understanding and connection
- **Ruthless Reduction**: Remove everything that doesn't directly serve the user
- **Material Honesty**: Visual elements reflect their actual function
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Users understand how to interact without instruction

### **Visual Design Direction (NOT Square/Geometric)**
- **Organic Curves and Flows**: Rounded corners, flowing lines, natural progressions
- **Depth Through Layering**: Subtle shadows, overlapping elements, dimensional hierarchy
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information reveals itself as users need it
- **Whitespace as Content**: Space used purposefully to create rhythm and focus
- **Typography as Art**: Text treatment that enhances meaning and emotion

### **Color Palette Strategy**
- **Primary Dark**: Deep navy/charcoal (#1a202c) - sophisticated dark mode feel
- **Secondary Blues**: Rich blue (#2d3748) and bright accent blue (#4299e1)
- **Purple Accents**: Deep purple (#553c9a) and bright purple (#9f7aea)
- **Bright Pink**: Vibrant pink accent (#ed64a6) for highlights and CTAs
- **White/Light**: Pure white (#ffffff) and light gray (#f7fafc) for contrast
- **Background**: Medium gray (#2d3748) to achieve dark mode aesthetic without full dark site

### **Typography Hierarchy**
- **Headlines**: Bold, commanding presence without being aggressive
- **Body Text**: Highly readable, conversational tone
- **Captions**: Subtle but informative
- **CTAs**: Clear action language that feels helpful, not pushy

# ClearForge Website - End-to-End Integration Test Plan
## Information Gathering & Integration Analysis

**Context:** We need to verify the ClearForge website can:
1. Display dynamic dashboards with real data from Xynergy CORE
2. Trigger content generation through XynergyOS/CORE
3. Show generated content to users
4. Connect to the Xynergy platform for demo/beta access

## PHASE 3: CONTENT GENERATION INTEGRATION

### A. Content Generation Flow (Target)

```
1. User visits website
2. User navigates to content generation demo
3. User inputs content parameters (topic, type, etc.)
4. Website calls backend API (→ XynergyOS → CORE)
5. Backend processes request via AI services
6. Website polls for completion status
7. Generated content is displayed on website
8. Content is saved to user's dashboard
```

### B. Current Implementation

**For each step above, assess:**
- [ ] Is this step implemented?
- [ ] What's the current status?
- [ ] What's blocking completion?

**Content Generation UI:**
- [ ] Does the UI exist?
- [ ] What inputs does it collect?
- [ ] How does it handle submission?
- [ ] Does it show progress/status?
- [ ] How does it display results?

**API Integration:**
- [ ] Which endpoint does the UI call?
- [ ] Is the endpoint implemented?
- [ ] Does it connect to XynergyOS/CORE?
- [ ] How are errors handled?

**Result Display:**
- [ ] How is generated content rendered?
- [ ] Is it saved to the user's account?
- [ ] Can users edit/download content?
- [ ] Is there a content library?

### C. Testing Content Generation

**What we need to test:**
1. [ ] User submits content generation request
2. [ ] Request reaches CORE Content Service
3. [ ] AI provider generates content
4. [ ] Content is returned to website
5. [ ] Content displays correctly
6. [ ] Content is saved for later access

**Current Blockers:**
- List specific issues preventing this flow

## PHASE 4: FORMS & DATA CAPTURE

### A. Contact Form
- [ ] Does it exist and where?
- [ ] What data does it collect?
- [ ] Where is data sent? (Email, Firestore, CRM)
- [ ] Is there confirmation/thank you page?
- [ ] Is validation implemented?

### B. Beta Signup Form
- [ ] Does it exist and where?
- [ ] What data does it collect?
- [ ] Where is data stored?
- [ ] Is there waitlist management?

## PHASE 5: INTEGRATION GAPS

### Missing Connections

**Backend Integration:**
- [ ] List endpoints that should exist but don't
